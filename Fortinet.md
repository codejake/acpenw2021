## Stuff I Like

### Internet Services Database (ISDB)

The Internet Service Database is a comprehensive public IP address database that combines IP address range, IP owner, service port number, and IP security credibility. The data comes from the FortiGuard service system. Information is regularly added to this database, for example, geographic location, IP reputation, popularity & DNS, and so on. All this information helps users define Internet security more effectively. You can use the contents of the database as criteria for inclusion or exclusion in a policy.
